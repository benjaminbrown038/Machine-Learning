# Using Python to perform data science procedures

```EDA_marketing.ipynb```

The data that is used in this example is marketing data. The marketing data is respresentative of 
characteristics of bank customers that are likely to stay (1) or not stay (1). 

The model used in this analysis is a Logistic Regression Model. 


```Assumptions_Logistic_Regression.ipynb```

The data used in this project is the Titanic Dataset. The dataset describes passenger aboard the Titanic who survived (1) or not (0). 


In order for a Machine Learning Engineer to use this data, a Data Scientist uses techniques to get the data ready for a MLE to train a model with. 

The EDA techniques used in this project are inclusive to Logistic Regression. They include making assumptions about the data going into the model.
